Like with all unilateral exercises, always work on both sides.<br />Execution: Your lower arm presses into the anchor point with elevated shoulder blades. At the same time your upper arm helps you balance your tightened body, by pulling with your lats and depressing your shoulder blade. Keep both arms straight. Engage your obliques to rotate your straight legs sideways. The end point is reached, when your legs are parallel to the ground. Keep a straight body and open up your chest, which should be perpendicular to the floor.
