<h3>Description:</h3>
<p>The difference between regular Push Ups and Pseudo Planche Push Ups is that you try to lean forward as far as possible (hands near hips). The Pseudo Push Ups will stress your wrists, straight arm and shoulder strength.</p>
<p>Execution:<br />Start in Push Up Hold position, your arms should be straight and your elbows locked out. Your scapula needs to be protracted, so push your shoulder down. Keep a tightened core and a hollow body. Slowly lean your upper body forward till you can still comfortably hold the position,, while keeping straight arms. Next slowly lower yourself and keep attention to remain a protracted scapula. Before you touch the ground, push yourself back up.<br />Hand placement: You can use different hand placement (fingers forward, fingers to the side, fingertips hold, fingers backward). Use the one you feel most comfortable with, but keep attention to don't overstress your wrists (you can reduce the stress on your writs by using parallettes or push up bars).</p>
