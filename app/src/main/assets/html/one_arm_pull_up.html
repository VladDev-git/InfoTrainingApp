<h3>Description:</h3>
<p>The One Arm Pull Up is a display of massive pulling power. Like with all unilateral exercises, always work on both sides.</p>
<p>Precondition: You should have at least 15 clean Pull Ups before starting to train for the One Arm Pull Up.</p>
<p>Execution: Start in an One Arm Dead Hang by gripping the bar with one hand. Keep tension in your torso to avoid rotating. Start the movement by pulling your shoulder blade down (this is also called Active One Arm Hang or One Arm Scapula Shrug). Bend your arm and pull yourself up with your back muscles and biceps. The aim is to touch the bar with the inactive shoulder.</p>
