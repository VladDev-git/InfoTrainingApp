<h3>Description:</h3>
<p>The Push Up is a basic exercise to build chest and triceps strength.</p>
<p>Execution:<br />Start in a plank position with your arms a bit more than shoulder wide apart. Your hands should be in line with your shoulders. Press your shoulders down (proctracted) and back (depressed). Turn your pelves in and keep a good tension in your whole body. Slowly lower yourself down and don't allow your elbows to turn widely outwards. Before your chest almost touches the ground, feel how your shoulder blades squeeze together and push yourself back up.<br />Variations: There are a lot of variations of the Push Up. For example you can make them easier by doing it inclined against a bench. You can make it more dynamic with Clapping Push Ups or harder witch Archer Push Ups or even One Arm Push Ups.</p>
