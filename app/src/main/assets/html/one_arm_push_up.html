<h3>Description:</h3>
<p>The One Arm Push Up is a great demonstration of pushing power. Performed with clean form it can be really challenging. You see the difference with the Rocky Push Ups. Bringing your feet closer together, your elbow in and your body always straight is much harder. Like with all unilateral exercises, always work on both sides.</p>
<p>Execution: Start in a Push Up position with your feet shoulder wide apart or a bit wider. Only if you can keep good form, try to bring them even closer together. Put one hand on your back or leg. Your body should be straight, with chest parallel to the ground. Don't allow it to rotate during the movement, especially pushing upwards. Keep your elbow in. Don't arch your back and lower yourself in control with your shoulder blade depressed. Push yourself up again.</p>
<p>Variations: The wider your feet are apart the easier it gets, because it will decrease the leverage. You can also reduce the necessary strength by rotating your body outwards. For the clean One Arm Push Up, your body shouldn't rotate outwards, but it should be parallel to the ground. Also your feet should be as close together as you can stabilize yourself without rotating.</p>
