<h3>Description:</h3>
<p>The Diamond Push Up is a variation of the normal Push Up, which will focus more on your triceps.</p>
<p>Execution: Form a triangle with your hands and place them on the ground in front of your chest. Your legs should be straight and together. Take on a horizontal and straight body position. Your pelvic should be normal or tilt backwards. This is very important, as you can cheat easily by bringing arching your back or bringing your glute to high. Furthermore your shoulder blades should be depressed and protacted. Keep your core engaged and stable. Initiate the movement by bending your arms and bringing your chest towards the ground. When your chest touches your hands, push yourself up into the starting position.</p>
<p>Variations: To increase the difficulty you can raise one leg into the air (Scorpion Push Up). Furthermore the exercise gets much harder if your hands are above your belly instead your chest. This will challenge your shoulder strength a lot.</p>
