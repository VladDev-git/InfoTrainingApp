<h3>Description:</h3>
<p>The Triceps Extension targets your triceps muscle. Other muscles e.g. the core are involed for stabilization, but the push should come from the triceps. The difficulty can be adjusted with your hand placement. Put the hands below your chin for a harder variation and in front of your head for an easier variation.</p>
<p><br />Execution</p>
<p>Step 1: On the ground start in a Plank position with your hands below your head. Keep a hollow body during the movement.</p>
<p>Step 2: Push from the palm of your hands and extend your arms. Keep the rest of the body (especially the shoulders) in the same position. Focus to push from the Triceps.</p>
