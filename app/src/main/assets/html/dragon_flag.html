<p>Step 1: Find a spot where you can grab something stable behind your head. This could be a bench, a couch or a bed. Keep your hands close to your head and your elbows in. The movement starts in a top position, so swing yourself up. Your weight should now rest on your shoulders.</p>
<p>Step 2: Now tense your whole body and bring it into a hollow body position. Slowly lower yourself while keeping the hollow body position.</p>
<p>Step 3: Before you touch the ground pull yourself back up and repeat. Keep attention to don't break the tension in your core. You have to keep the hollow body position, otherwise you will hurt your back. You can decrease the difficulty be tucking your legs in or by reducing the range of motion.</p>
