<h1><strong>V-sit</strong></h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>Technique Summary:</strong></h3>
<p>- Straight arms</p>
<p>-&nbsp;Elbows locked out</p>
<p>- Scapula protracted</p>
<p>- Body parallel to the ground</p>
<p>- Hips on level with shoulders</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Description:</h3>
<p>The V-Sit demands 3 things:<br /> 1. Support strength<br /> 2. Abs strength<br /> 3. Hamstring flexibility</p>
<p>The support strength is needed to raise from the ground through pushing with your arms and shoulders (scapula depression). So if you think your arms are to short to perform this skill, maybe you just doesn't depress your scapula enough. Next you need strong abs to lift your legs from the ground. The most leverage to lift will be with straight legs. The more flexible hamstrings you have, the easier it will be to extend your legs. In order to get from the L-Sit to the V-Sit you need to push your hips forward and up.</p>
