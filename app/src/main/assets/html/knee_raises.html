<h3>Description:</h3>
<p>Knee Raises are a basic exercise to train your abs. You will need your hip flexors, lower abs and in the end your upper abs</p>
<p>Execution:<br />Start in a dead hang and don't arch your back, try to have a hollow body position. Slowly pull your knees and hip up towards your chest, by engaging your abs. Don't just swing the legs up, but be in control of the movement. At the top your knees should be at least over hip level. Pause there briefly and slowly lower your legs. Keep a hollow body and don't arch your back.<br />Variations: You can also perform Knee Raises on Rings, Parallel Bars or even between chairs. You can increase the difficulty by straighting your legs.</p>
