<h3>Description:</h3>
<p>The Planche is one of the most impressive Calisthenic skills and requires a lot of wrist, straight arm and shoulder strength. In a Planche you hold your body parallel to the ground with your legs in the air. Lean far forward (hands below hip) in order to keep your balance. Your arms should be straight and your elbows locked out. Your scapula needs to protracted, so push your shoulder down. With a tightened core and a hollow body keep your body in a position where it is parallel to the ground.</p>

Use the one you feel most comfortable with, but keep attention to don't overstress your wrists (you can reduce the stress on your writs by using parallettes or push up bars).</p>
