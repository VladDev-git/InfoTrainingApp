<p>- No swing</p>
<p>- Full range of motion (ROM)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Description:</h3>
<p>The Pull Up is a basic calisthenic exercise, which is a precondition for more advanced skills on the bar.<br />Progression Goal: Build basic upper body strength for a Muscle Up.</p>
<p>Execution:<br />The exercise starts in a dead hang. The movement is initialized through depressing and retracting the scapula. Next you pull yourself up by engaging your biceps and back muscles. Pull till your chin surpasses the bar (even better till your chest touches the bar). Descend slowly and controlled into a dead hang position. It is important to always perform the full range of motion.</p>
<p>Variations:<br />The Chin-Up is done with an underhand grip in contrast to the overhand grip of the Pull-Up. With the underhand grip your elbows naturally bend more inwards, by what your biceps will be targeted to a greater extent. Instead of bars you can perform the Pull-Up also on rings.</p>
