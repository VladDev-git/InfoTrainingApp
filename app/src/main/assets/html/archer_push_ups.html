<h3>Description:</h3>
<p>The Archer Push Up is an intermediate exercise to build chest and triceps strength.</p>
<p>Execution:<br />Start in a plank position with your arms wide apart. Press your shoulders down (proctracted) and back (depressed). Turn your pelves in and keep a good tension in your whole body. Slowly lower yourself down to one side by bending one arm and keeping the other one straight (the more you bend the assisting arm, the easier the exercise gets). Don't allow the elbow of your bending arm to turn widely outwards. Before your chest almost touches the ground, feel how your shoulder blades squeeze together and push yourself back up.</p>
