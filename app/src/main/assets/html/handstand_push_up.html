<h3>Description:</h3>
<p>Execution:<br />The handstand push up combines push strength and balance. Start in a Handstand and descend controlled by keeping a straight body and leaning forward (a hollow body needs more strength than a arched back). Before your nose touches the ground push yourself up by keeping your elbows inwards. One rep counts if it was performed in full range of motion (nose almost touching ground &amp; open shoulders in handstand position)</p>
