<h3>Description:</h3>
<p>Execution:<br />Start in a dead hang. You can swing a bit forward. Initiate the movement by quickly retracting and depressiing your scapula. Simultaneously explosivly pull your body up and try to geht as high as possible. Don't pull yourself under the bar but behind the bar. Shortly before the highest position pull yourself towards the bar by moving your elbows backwards and pulling the bar to your chest/hip.<br />The minimum for one repetition to count is getting the bar to the middle the chest. Nevertheless your goal should be to get the bar to the abs or even hips.</p>
