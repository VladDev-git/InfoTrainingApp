<h3>Description:</h3>
<p>Execution:<br />Start in a dead hang position with an underhand grip. Your hands should be less than shoulder wide apart and your elbows should be turned in the whole movement. This positioning puts more stress on your biceps than with the regular Pull Up. Raise your straight legs up into a 90&deg; angle until they are parallel to the ground. Keep this L-sit through the whole movement. Wit this starting position, pull yourself up by engaging your biceps and back muscles till your chin surpasses the bar (even better till your chest surpasses the bar). Descend slowly and controlled until dead hang in order to reach full range of motion.</p>
