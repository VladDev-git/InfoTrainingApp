<h3>Description:</h3>
<p>The Dip is a fundamental exercise to train your triceps and chest.</p>
<p>Execution:<br />This exercise is performed on parallel bars. Start in an upright support hold position. If the bars aren't high enough you can bend your legs. Keep your body straight and your elbows in, in order to target your triceps. If you lean forward and let your elbows go out, more tension will go to your chest and shoulders. Lower yourself until your arms have at least a 90&deg; angle. Push yourself upwards to the initial position without swing. <br />Variations: You can also perform a Dip on rings, a single bar or even between two chairs. These variations can be much harder than the simple parallel bar Dip.</p>
